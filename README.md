# Caeser Cipher

## About 
- A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on

## BDD
- This application runs on the terminal
- It uses a key between 1-26 to encrypt/decrypt a message depending on the shift key user chooses
- Once run the the application prompts user to key in the message they wish to encrypt
- User is then prompted to input the shift key/ encryption 
- Once all the above are captured the application encrypts the message using the shift key and displays to user both the encrypted message and the original message .
